When I was younger, I was deeply passionate about politics and dreamed of creating a game that could simulate the complex political landscape and major global events. My goal was to help people better understand realpolitik—the practical realities of politics—so they could be less susceptible to manipulation and make more informed decisions.

Back then, gathering the materials to build a board game was a daunting task, so the idea was set aside. Fast forward to today, and with the rise of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, creating such a game has become much more feasible. Now, I’m excited to revive this project—not only as a tool for learning about politics but also as a way to explore the potential of AI in game design.

I will document an end-to-end software development process to create a board game using AI, as well as the rational
behind the technical decisions, to help others understand the process and the potential of AI in game design.

## Action Plan

1. Create the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/smgil/grillopoly) and define the collaboration proceses.
2. Define the rules of the game, define the material required, and the implementation plan. 
3. Use AI to generate the content for the game, such as the rules, the board, the pieces, and the cards.
